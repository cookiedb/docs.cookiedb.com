# Getting Started

In this chapter of the CookieDB documentation, you will be introduced to some of
the core concepts. You will learn some of the parallels between CookieDB
terminology and other technologies that exist. You will also learn how to
self-host a CookieDB instance.

The documentation assumes you have some experience with programming and (if you
want to self-host) the command line.
