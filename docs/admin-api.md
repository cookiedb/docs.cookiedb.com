# Admin API

In this chapter of the CookieDB documentation, you will be introduced to the
admin API. In general, you should not be using this API unless you have some
very specific niche usecase. Please reach out to us if you do! We'd love to hear
what you are doing with CookieDB!

All of these methods are disabled for the cloud-hosted version. If you are an
enterprise and are interested in this being enabled for your accounts, please
reach out.

The documentation assumes you have some experience with programming and (if you
want to use curl) the command line.
